# Pt_CCM_T
[Pt_CCM_multi.py](https://github.com/limengwsu/Pt_CCM_T/blob/main/Pt_CCM_multi.py) simulates CCM Ci fluxes in diatom *Phaeodactylum triconutum* at different temperatures. The code is adapted from [Fcyl_CCM/Li_2022](https://github.com/limengwsu/Fcyl_CCM/tree/main/Li_2022).

## Software requirement

Python 3.7, Text editor Spyder 4.0.1 or above recommended. The Python scripts have been tested last time in Python 3.7.7 using Spyder 4.0.1.

## Input and Output

### Input: 

The Pt_T.csv file provides parameter information to Pt_CCM_multi.py, I recommend put the two files in one folder and run that within the same folder.

### Output:

Steady state fluxes and Ci concentrations in csv format, plots of Ci concentrations overtime in pdf format. 

All files will be written within the default folder.

See [Fcyl_CCM/Li_2022](https://github.com/limengwsu/Fcyl_CCM/tree/main/Li_2022) for more details.
